	               			<img src="/img/launch-schedule.png" class="img-responsive"></img>
	               			<p>Have your content ready and schedule a time for launch. When should you launch?</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Monday is not a good day for launching.</strong> You’re up all weekend preparing for a Monday launch. This creates problems internally and your launch will be affected.</li>
									<li><strong>Tuesday through Thursday are great.</strong>  “If we can get it on Hacker News' number one spot on Tuesday, we'll have this many page views and we're going to have this many sign-ups, and that's great,” Kerstiens says.</li>
									<li><strong>Fridays are good for smaller products.</strong> “If Twitter volume is busier on Tuesday, but quieter on Friday, and if I can launch a tier two or tier three, a smaller product update, I can get eyeballs that I wouldn't otherwise get. Other people are competing for those, so this is a really nice opportunity.”</li>
									<li><strong>Weekends work for posts.</strong> “For smaller, interesting engineering blog posts, thought leadership, etc, it's really easy to do. Weekends are quiet, but there's still developers reading and engaging with your content on the weekends.”</li>

						<h2>Timing your PR Pitch</h2>

						<h2>Third Party Channels</h2>
							<p>“On the beginner content piece, really what you want to do is have your content live on a third party property… As your product grows and becomes more complex, you're going to want to focus on that, and then how do you get other people engaged and contributing?”</p>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Free advertising, outreach</li>
									<li>Captive audience already on a site, or you can build a new audience</li>
									<li>Good for SEO, Retargeting</li>
									<li>Low investment for a high return of visitors</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>Here’s a few third party content platforms with Kerstiens’s at the top:</p>

								<ul>
									<li>postgresguide.com</li>
									<li>javais.cool</li>
