					<h2>What makes a site popular?</h2>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>No sign-up: the faster the consumer can get to the product, the better</li>
								<li>Does one thing well: as opposed to a million things not so well</li>
								<li>It’s free: who doesn’t love free stuff?</li>
							</ul>

					<h1>Community Projects</h1>
						<p>“We have had a really good run of success with this, so we are constantly on the look out for new community projects,” Sheehan says. RequestBin is linked to from sites including MailChimp.</p>
						<p>In this video, Meghan Murphy of Twilio describes the <a href="http://www.heavybit.com/library/video/2014-08-12-meghan-murphy">“ROI of Community.”</a></p>

					<h2>Retargeting</h2>
						<p>“Our community projects between direct, organic referrals and retargeting refer about 33% of our sign-ups for an average cost per acquisition for retargeting of about 2 dollars… I consider this roughly like free sign-ups.”</p>
